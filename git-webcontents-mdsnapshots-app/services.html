	<h3 class="">Wedding photography</h3>
	<p class="text-justify">
	For weddings I will work according to a fixed price or hourly rate, whichever is most advantageous to clients. 
	Please contact me to request a written quote. For your information, please review the following bullet points about my 
	wedding photography service applicable to all clients: 
	</p> 
	
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>
			Wedding photography can vary from a basic service for a brief (ceremony + 1 hr of reception) contract 
			to a much longer affair entailing full day & night continuous shooting, engagement studio shoots and 
			destination weddings and prices vary accordingly. While wedding photography is often priced outrageously 
			high, I don't believe in charging more for weddings than I would for any other type of event unless 
			warranted by additional demands. My fees therefore can start as low as $500 and rarely exceed $3500. 
		</li>
		<li>
			A typical wedding yields between 600-2000 photos (for the wedding day alone) 
		</li>
		<li>
			All (or a selection made by the client) unedited images are also available for delivery by password 
			protected download at high resolution (large JPEG files) upon client request at no additional charge. 
		</li>
		<li>
			All images are transferred with full, unlimited rights to client in perpetuity for no additional charge 
		</li>
		<li>
			A minimum of 25 image edits are included with all wedding packages and up to an unlimited number of 
			edited images are included with wedding packages priced $2900+. Additional image edits by my professional 
			team of image editors and retouchers are available at $10/image or less depending on size of order and 
			edits requested. Please contact us for a quote 
		</li>
		<li>
			No photos of guests are taken during mealtimes other than speeches and toasts. If your contract entails 
			more than 8hrs of service a meal for the photographer must be included. 
		</li>
		<li>
			Photos can be all view thru my website and required user name and password to get access. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<br/>
	<h3 class="">Corporate portrait photography</h3>
	<p class="text-justify">
	Corporate portrait photography needs vary from coming in to an office to take a single portrait, to doing a 
	complete office of 50+ staff or more. Accordingly prices vary, but significant discounts are available for 
	volume as the time for set-up and take down remains the same regardless of the number of shots taken. Please 
	contact me to request a written quote. For your information, please review the following bullet points about 
	my corporate portrait photography service applicable to all clients: 
	</p> 
	
	<ul class="text-justify">
		<li>
			The minimum amount of time needed for a good family portrait session is 2hrs (whether you are a family of 2 or 20). 
			This time includes assessing optimal set up areas (if the photos are to be taken in your home), lighting set-ups, 
			and some "getting to know you" time particularly important for families with young children. The creation of a 
			family portrait is the creation of a family and as such deserves some special attention. Part of my work as a 
			family portrait photographer is to capture the essence and uniqueness of your specific family in a specific moment 
			in time which means we need a little time to get to know each other.  
		</li>
		<li>
			A typical family portrait session starts at $100 
		</li>
		<li>
			A typical family portrait session can yield from between 50-250+ photos to choose from 
		</li>
		<li>
			Photos are shot in full colour but can be delivered in either colour or black and white 
			(editing fees apply for black and white delivery) 
		</li>
		<li>
			All (or a selection made by the client) unedited images are also available for delivery by password protected 
			download at high resolution (large JPEG files) upon client request at no additional charge. 
		</li>
		<li>
			 Photos can be all view thru my website and required user name and password to get access.

	<h3 class="">Discounts and rate reductions:</h3>
	<p class="text-justify">
	I do give discounts to registered charities and non-profits regularly and will accept requests for more such work in the future, 
	but cannot guarantee I will be able to satisfy every request. It never hurts to ask though.
